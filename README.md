# World Population Analysis 

## Introduction

Introduction/Project Overview:

The world's population is a critical demographic metric that shapes various aspects of our global society. Understanding population trends, growth rates, and distribution is vital for policymakers, researchers, and anyone interested in the dynamics of human societies. This project harnesses the 'wolrd_population' dataset to analyze and visualize key population statistics using SQL queries. The dataset contains population data with three column; country, year and total population allowing us to explore and extract valuable insights.

The project consists of five SQL queries that provide different perspectives on world population dynamics.


## Data Source
**World Population dataset**: the primary dataset used for this project is gotten from **_Kaggle_**


## Tools/Skills
 
- Excel - data cleaning
- Mysql - Data analysis


## Data Cleaning and Preparation
In the initial data preparation phase, we perform the following tasks:
- Data loading and inspection
- Data cleaning and formating.



## Exploratory data analysis

 EDA involve exploring the sales to answer key questions, such as

1. Top 10 Countries with the Highest Population in 2015

2. Yearly World Population Growth Rate
3. Average Population Growth Rate per Year

4. Top 10 Countries with the Highest Population Growth Rate in 2015

5. Population Distribution by Countries in 2015


## Data analysis
  These are the SQL functions/statement/Clause used in this query:
  - Aggregate functions
  - JOINS (Inner Join, Left Join, and Self Join)
  - Clause (WHERE, ORDER BY, GROUP BY and LIMIT)


## Results /Findings

- China has the highest population in 2015 with 1371220000 population, followed by Indian, United States, Indonesia, Brazil, Pakistan, Nigeria, Bangladesh, Russian Federation, Japan in 2015.
- 2014 has the highest growth rate 


By running these SQL queries on the 'wolrd_population' dataset, we can gain valuable insights into global population trends, making this project a useful tool for those interested in demographics, social sciences, and policy-making. The results will be presented in a clear and organized manner, facilitating a better understanding of the world's population dynamics.
